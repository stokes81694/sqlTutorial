In Lesson 01, we will learn how to form hypotheses and generate descriptive statistics that can provide insight into your data. We will implement five exercises and two activities in this lesson to analyze and get insights of the data. There arenn't any code files in this lessons as most of the practical elements help us to undestand data analytics using Excel and a few datasets. We have used dealerships.csv, heights.csv, and auto_upgrades.csv datasets to perform these exericses and activities. These datasets can be found in the **Datasets** folder of this repository. Here is the link to these datasets: https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Datasets
